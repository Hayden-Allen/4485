<h1>About Page</h1>

<p>
    We aim to provide non-technical users with a means to implement their own 2D arcade-style game ideas. Our product will be a web-based turnkey solution for no-code game development, with primary attention being given to a WYSIWYG level editor, a minimalist, no-code trigger/action system for defining entity behaviors, and a hosting platform serving a live, playable-in-browser instance of published games at a public URL.
