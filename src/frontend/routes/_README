This directory contains all of the site's pages.

Each page gets its own directory.
For example, the edit page (localhost:5173/edit) is stored in the edit folder in this directory.

Each page needs a +page.svelte, which defines the structure of the page.

If a page makes any API calls (ie., calls to functions defined in src/backend), it needs a corresponding +server.js in src/frontend/routes/api/{page}.
For example, the kittens page (src/frontend/routes/kittens/+page.svelte) uses the createKitten function from src/backend/api/kittens.js.
Therefore, it has a +server.js file in src/frontend/routes/api/kittens. This file defines and exports the HTTP requests it responds to as functions.
