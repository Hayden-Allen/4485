This directory contains scripts to test our code.
The testing framework used is mocha. You can probably figure out how it works just by the code, or at https://mochajs.org/#getting-started.

These are run automatically when you push any branch to GitHub.
For reference, this is set up in .github/workflows/AutomatedTesting.yaml (you shouldn't have to change this file).
Any .js files that you add to this directory will automatically be run.

Primarily, we want to write tests to validate the integration of large systems.
For example, we should have a test to check that the search page can correctly download the thumbnail image for a game, or one that ensures that the user can see their projects from their account page.

Tests written to validate independent pieces of code in a vacuum (unit tests) may be written, but don't go crazy.
We don't have a whole lot of time for this project, so leaving unit testing up to the code author is probably better (ie., test functionality by using it, don't write automated tests to do it).
